<h1 class="western">About us:</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> Intsonic offers application specific sensor devices design and fabrication, addressing a large number of areas, including (but not limited to) oil/gas, automotive, robotics and other industrial ultrasonic applications. We also provide support for companies implementing UT, such as electronics setup and tuning, signal processing, analysis software and firmware development. At the moment, our largest areas of expertise are air-coupled ultrasound and metrology.

<h1 class="western">Vision:</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> The main objective is to create an innovative technology company for design/manufacture of ultrasonic devices and solutions. Our company strives to utilize advanced production methods to create application specific device design, while minimizing manufacturing costs to provide the growing market with opportunities to use UT in their various products/solutions, both existing and new.    

<h1 class="western">Approach:</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> Intsonic aims to offer a strong knowledge base and continuous innovation. We are planning to adapt advance manufacturing methods from other areas of manufacturing to UT production, and are using rapid prototyping to drive our innovation. Specifically, the company activities include: consultancy to develop from proof of concept setups, provision of complete systems/solutions, prototype manufacture, and low volume production. <br />
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> Also, our company is looking to quickly expand into a turnkey ultrasonic solutions provider by collaborating with companies on the following areas: materials (ceramic, functional polymers/plastics etc.) and electronics.   
&nbsp; 

<h1 class="western">Our projects:</h1>
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> Our largest and longest project so far has been the development of a domestic ultrasonic gas meter. For it, we have worked on the sensor design, the internal components design, electronics components testing. As a result, we have produced a fully functional meter prototype that is currently undergoing testing.
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> Working with a local university, we have developed an ultrasonic air flow evaluation module that will be used to demonstrate one of the uses of ultrasound in biomedical engineering.
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Liberation Serif', serif;"> 
We are also currently developing a water and heat meter.
