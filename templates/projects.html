            The main project at the moment is the development of a DN50 inline water meter. 
            <br>
            Our vision is to produce a safe, easily deployable meter that requires minimal maintanance at an affordable price. We are working to add various connectivity options, with pulsed output and serial (RS485) already done and wireless MBUS is down the line.
            The aim is to allow easy integration with existing monitoring and analytics systems as well as deployment of new ones. We hope that further reduction in waste water can be achieved through leakage localisation.
            <br>
            We have conducted extensive testing to ensure that the meter can operate and maintain high accuracy under various operating conditions, especially when disturbances and unwanted mechanics are present in the flow. For example swirl or uneven flow profile.
            Our meter is completely non-intrusive into the flow, with only one material in contact with water.
            <br>
            At the moment, we are looking to get our meter calibrated with accordance to UKAS and then field-tested.

            Our second largest and the longest project so far has been the development of a domestic ultrasonic gas meter.
            For it, we have worked on the transducer design, the internal components design, electronics components
            evaluation and programming. As a result, we have produced a fully functional meter prototype that is
            currently
            undergoing testing.&nbsp;

            Working with Birmingham City University, we have developed an ultrasonic air flow evaluation module that
            will be used to demonstrate one of the uses of ultrasound in biomedical engineering.&nbsp;
