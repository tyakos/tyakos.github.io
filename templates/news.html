        <div class="content is-medium">
            Today I wanted to reveal a bit of information on one of the projects that we have been working on in the last few months.

We are entering the late phases in our inline DN50 ultrasonic water meter development. The demand for this class of meters have been growing and we are looking to provide a modern affordable solution.

The three main areas that we are trying to address in our meter are as follows:

<li> Accuracy. For an ultrasonic meter, the two critical areas are the low end of the flow speed range, where the accuracy is limited by the zero-flow drift, and the high end, where various flow dynamics play the key role. I will write more on this in the future.</li>

<li> Ease of use and reliability. We have designed the meter to be water-tight by design. The only source of leakage could be the threads or direct damage to the meter body. We are planning to conduct additional testing to make sure that theses risks are brought down to a minimum.
At the moment, we are gathering information from companies installing and maintaining the meters about the features that are important to them, common problems and misconceptions.</li>

<li>Low cost. We aim to achieve this by having a fully injection moulded meter body, simple assembly and modular electronics. Currently we are working on the heart of the meter – the ultra-low power metrological module that does the ultrasonic measurements and the relevant flow calculations. Any additional functionality such as communication modules can be added on top of that. </li>

In case you would like request some additional information, are interested in testing one of our prototypes, wish for a specific feature or simply want to chat and provide feedback – feel free to contact us.
