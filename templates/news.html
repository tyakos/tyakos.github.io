			<p>
				We have contributed to a very exciting project lead by Craig Marshall at Friction Flow Measurement and TÜV SÜD NEL. Together with Nishal Ramadas from Hy-Met ltd we put together a 2-path DN100 ultrasonic sensor. Despite the very limited time we had to work on this we managed to obtain some very reasonable data and are looking forward to introducing further improvements. Additional thanks goes to Konrad Kuczynski for putting measurement system together and getting it to work at the lab. <br>

        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> 
       		Last week we added a gravimetric test system to our rig to allow for very accurate calibration of our larger meter sizes at low flowrates. In addition, we will use it to calibrate the upcoming smaller meter prototypes (DN20 preliminarily).
		<p>
			A good, calibrated set of scales is very hard to beat. And having tested a few meters that we were using as reference – I wish we had installed it sooner!

        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> 
       		We got our meter tested by the great team at WRc. Low flow performance is good with repeatability of 0.2-0.7% in the 50-100 l/h range. <b>That indicates that our meters should have a turndown ratio of R400 with R800 as and option instead of the intially predicted R250.</b> That's right, even more accurate measurements of minimal night flows!<br>
       		High flow performance also looking fantastic with excellent repeatability. In fact, the meter performed well all the way up to 70 m<sup>3</sup>/h. A little bit more work is needed to achieve the next Q<sub>3</sub> of 63 m<sup>3</sup>/h as performance at the corresponding Q<sub>4</sub> (78.75 m<sup>3</sup>/h) is not yet stable, however preliminary data suggests that it is achievable. <br>
       		Overall, we are quite pleased with the results and are hoping to fix all the remaining hiccups very quickly.
       	</p>
		<p>
       		Secondly the continued internal tests have allowed us to significantly improve the temperature performance of the meters.<br>
       		Together with the external test results this brings us very close to the end of the testing and I am very much looking forward to demonstrating the full potential of this technology.

       		We built a new flow rig that has allowed us to do a lot of controlled testing. So far we have established that the meter needs between 20D and 40D upsteam and about 10D downstream to achieve full accuracy, but perhaps the requirements can be relaxed to achieve the ±2% required in the OIML R49 class 2. Repeatability is looking great in the 0.2 - 8 m/s range, down to about 0.2-0.5%. In the coming weeks we have planned testing at an external facility to verify these results.

        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> 
       		When calculating the minimum wall thickness for a plastic pipe a safety factor of around 3 is usually used at the operating pressure. We have done static pressure simulations to determine what is the maximum size of meter we can go up to at 16 bar.<br>
       		And that is 100mm! In fact, our current 50mm prototype is about 2 times stronger than it needs to be. Which makes sense, our wall thickness is 4.5mm, the plastic is about two times stronger than regular pipe PVC, and PN16 PVC pipes are typically 3.7mm thick.<br>
       		Moreover, larger meters will be more accurate as lower flows (in terms of m/s) and allow two ultrasonic paths to be used in order to maintain accuracy at high flows. So ultimately a higher turndown ratio can be achieved.
		</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Secondly, here are some photos of our latest prototype with a nice transparent lid prototype.

        <h1 class="title">18/02/22: Water meter calibration and ultra low flow data</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> For the last two months we had our meters tested at a fantastic facility with very accurate equipement allowing both high and low flow testing. <br>
       		Getting straight to the results (keep in mind this is a DN50 meter).
			<ul>
			 	<li>±1% error on 1 - 50 m<sup>3</sup>/h with 1% repeatability.</li>
				<li>±5% error down to about 40 l/h with about 2% repeatability.</li>	 	
			</ul>
		The fastest flow we could test was about 59 m<sup>3</sup>/h. At that point the repeatability started going up to about 2%. This is, more or less, to be expected as 59 m<sup>3</sup>/h roughly corresponds to 10 m/s, which is typically the maximum measured flow speed by inline ultrasonic meters with a single transducer pair. <br>
		The lowest flow that was tested was 15 l/h and we managed to get a measurement, but unfortunately there is no repeatability data that I can share.<br>
		We are going to incorporate this data (including the ultra-low flow data points) into the calibration curve to futher improve linearity.
		</p>	
		<p>	The data suggests that the meter is actually R400 rather than R250 as we thought previously. Of course, more testing is required to verify that.<br>
			However, we have decided that even R400 does not sound that impressive for a new ultrasonic meter. As mentioned, increasing Q<sub>3</sub> is difficult and probably unnecessary for a water meter. Hence Q<sub>1</sub> has to go down. 
		</p>
		<p>	Ultrasonic meters low-flow performance is commonly limited by zero-flow drift, which usually occurs with changes in temperature. Basically, this is the value that the meter reads when no flow is present.
		    This introduces an absolute error into the measurements that mostly determines repeatability at low flows. For example, a zero-flow drift of ±1 l/h would give 2/40*100 = 5% repeatability at 40 l/h. <br>
			So we have begun work on an improved version of the meter that would have a lower zero-flow drift and we will be testing the prototypes next week. 
		</p>
		<p>	Lastly, we have designed and built a few OEM-style modules with the minimum number of components in it, basically just the ultra-low-power ultrasonic measurement part: meter body, transducers and the electronics with a RS232/I<sup>2</sup>C/SPI interface. With enough demand we are planning to offer evaluation kits. As always, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@intsonic.com">info@intsonic.com</a> to register your interest.

		<p> We will be back with more regular updates regarding this project!

       	<p> A quick update on the top lid design. It has been changed to make the assembly process simpler and save costs. The idea is to have the top part of the enclosure made out of a clear plastic – but only transparent in the parts where it is necessary and frosted elsewhere. </p>

        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> Another calibration run using a different rig that allowed us to test much lower flowrates. At 300 l/h we got a ±2% error, and ±1.5% on 1 - 40 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>
       	<p> So we have again updated the calibration curve which should get us sub 1% linearity on 0.6 - 48 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>
       	<p> 5% error can likely be achived on flowrates as low as 120 l/h. Hence for OIML/MID certification the values would likely be as follows: Q<sub>1</sub>=0.160 m<sup>3</sup>/h, Q<sub>3</sub>=40 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>
