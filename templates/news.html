        <h1 class="title">16/03/22: More water meter sizes, pressure ratings and lid demo</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> 
       		When calculating the minimum wall thickness for a plastic pipe a safety factor of around 3 is usually used at the operating pressure. We have done static pressure simulations to determine what is the maximum size of meter we can go up to at 16 bar.<br>
       		And that is 100mm! In fact, our current 50mm prototype is about 2 times stronger than it needs to be. Which makes sense, our wall thickness is 4.5mm, the plastic is about two times stronger than regular pipe PVC, and PN16 PVC pipes are typically 3.7mm thick.<br>
       		Moreover, larger meters will be more accurate as lower flows (in terms of m/s) and allow two ultrasonic paths to be used in order to maintain accuracy at high flows. So ultimately a higher turndown ratio can be achieved.
		</p>
	  	<p>
	  		Secondly, here are some photos of our latest prototype with a nice transparent lid prototype.

        <h1 class="title">18/02/22: Water meter calibration and ultra low flow data</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> For the last two months we had our meters tested at a fantastic facility with very accurate equipement allowing both high and low flow testing. <br>
       		Getting straight to the results (keep in mind this is a DN50 meter).
			<ul>
			 	<li>±1% error on 1 - 50 m<sup>3</sup>/h with 1% repeatability.</li>
				<li>±5% error down to about 40 l/h with about 2% repeatability.</li>	 	
			</ul>
		The fastest flow we could test was about 59 m<sup>3</sup>/h. At that point the repeatability started going up to about 2%. This is, more or less, to be expected as 59 m<sup>3</sup>/h roughly corresponds to 10 m/s, which is typically the maximum measured flow speed by inline ultrasonic meters with a single transducer pair. <br>
		The lowest flow that was tested was 15 l/h and we managed to get a measurement, but unfortunately there is no repeatability data that I can share.<br>
		We are going to incorporate this data (including the ultra-low flow data points) into the calibration curve to futher improve linearity.
		</p>	
		<p>	The data suggests that the meter is actually R400 rather than R250 as we thought previously. Of course, more testing is required to verify that.<br>
			However, we have decided that even R400 does not sound that impressive for a new ultrasonic meter. As mentioned, increasing Q<sub>3</sub> is difficult and probably unnecessary for a water meter. Hence Q<sub>1</sub> has to go down. 
		</p>
		<p>	Ultrasonic meters low-flow performance is commonly limited by zero-flow drift, which usually occurs with changes in temperature. Basically, this is the value that the meter reads when no flow is present.
		    This introduces an absolute error into the measurements that mostly determines repeatability at low flows. For example, a zero-flow drift of ±1 l/h would give 2/40*100 = 5% repeatability at 40 l/h. <br>
			So we have begun work on an improved version of the meter that would have a lower zero-flow drift and we will be testing the prototypes next week. 
		</p>
		<p>	Lastly, we have designed and built a few OEM-style modules with the minimum number of components in it, basically just the ultra-low-power ultrasonic measurement part: meter body, transducers and the electronics with a RS232/I<sup>2</sup>C/SPI interface. With enough demand we are planning to offer evaluation kits. As always, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@intsonic.com">info@intsonic.com</a> to register your interest.
		</p>
		<p> We will be back with more regular updates regarding this project!

        <h1 class="title">09/11/21: Water meter: lid design updates</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> A quick update on the top lid design. It has been changed to make the assembly process simpler and save costs. The idea is to have the top part of the enclosure made out of a clear plastic – but only transparent in the parts where it is necessary and frosted elsewhere. </p>
       	<p> Some photos of the 3D-printed prototype below. The injection-moulded part will obviously be clearer. </p>

        <h1 class="title">01/11/21: Water meter: further calibration and accuracy</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> Another calibration run using a different rig that allowed us to test much lower flowrates. At 300 l/h we got a ±2% error, and ±1.5% on 1 - 40 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>
       	<p> So we have again updated the calibration curve which should get us sub 1% linearity on 0.6 - 48 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>
       	<p> 5% error can likely be achived on flowrates as low as 120 l/h. Hence for OIML/MID certification the values would likely be as follows: Q<sub>1</sub>=0.160 m<sup>3</sup>/h, Q<sub>3</sub>=40 m<sup>3</sup>/h.</p>

        <h1 class="title">06/10/21: Water meter: calibration and a few common questions</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p> We did another calibration run earlier this week. For one of the meters we got an average error of -0.36% out of the box on the 5-40 m<sup>3</sup>/h range and a maximum error just over 2% on the 1-45 m<sup>3</sup>/h range. 
		<br> We are now fairly confident that with a few tweaks to our calibration curve we will be able to achieve a sub 1% error on the above range. 
		<br> The last thing will be determining the Q<sup>1</sup> and the accuracy and repeatability at the lower flow ranges. 		
	 	</p>
       	<p> Lastly I would like to address a few question that we had people ask us about our meters.
			<ul>
			 	<li><i>What liquids can be measured with the meter?</i>
			 		<br> This comes down to two factors: chemical compatability with the plastic of the meter body and the speed of sound in the given liquid. For example, we might be able to do acids and alcohols but unable to do hydrocarbons. Please equire for a specific application.
			 	</li>
				<li><i>Are there other sizes (other than DN50) available?</i>
					<br> DN50 is currently the only size we offer. We plan to expand our range to inculde a DN25 model next year.

        <h1 class="title">16/09/21: Water meter updates, user manual and pricing</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p>
       		For the last 2 months we were busy with various improvements and optimiazations. We shipped our first two units for field-testing and validation.
       		<br> The serial interface protocol got a significant update which allowed for a reduction of the interface power consumption by 30%. At the same time, more functionality has been added. For example, it is now possible to download selected log entrees from the meter instead of the whole log. This can be useful in situations when only the last day of operation is of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
		 A full list of features can be found in the user manual, which we are publically releasing today. It can be downloaded <a href="files/Intsonic_user_manual_v1.2.pdf">here</a>. It includes information on the display and button interface as well as the pulsed output and the serial interface. A large section is dedicated to our software. The software itself is not publically available yet. The manual will be updated to include more detail in the coming weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
       		 We are planning to initially offer two models – <b>Full</b> which includes the connector, display and button. And <b>Minimal</b> which only includes the connector and is intended for users that plan to take full advantage of the serial interface.
       		<br> Finally, we are ready to announce the preliminary pricing for the two models. It can be found on the <a href=/products data-navigo>Products</a> page.

        <h1 class="title">07/07/21: Calibration</h1>
        <div class="content is-medium">
       	<p>
       		Earlier this week we had the opportunity to use an excellent gravimetric system to calibrate a few of our meters.
       		<br> With barely any adjustment we managed to get a sub 4% error on the whole operating range. The highest flow that we were able to generate was ~53 m<sup>3</sup>/h and our meter handled it without issues. 
       		<br> Next – we will use this data to minimise the error of indication. We then verify it with another calibration and the first fully calibrated units will be ready to ship.
