Our largest and longest project so far has been the development of a domestic ultrasonic gas meter. 
For it, we have worked on the sensor design, the internal components design, electronics components testing. As a result, we have produced a fully functional meter prototype that is currently undergoing testing. 
</p>
<p>
Working with a local university, we have developed an ultrasonic air flow evaluation module that will be used to demonstrate one of the uses of ultrasound in biomedical engineering. 
</p>
<p>
We are also currently developing a water and heat meter.
